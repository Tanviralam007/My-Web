                incapacity for service or work, as a result of a service injury or disease to at least the same physical
                and
                psychological state, and at least the same social, vocational and educational status, as he or she had
                before

            <h3>What they were doing might be a good way to practice if the goal is to use one club to hit the same
                distance
                at the same target several times in a row. But it's a terrible way if you want to play well on a real
                course, where the lie is almost never perfectly level, there are delays between successive shots, and
                you
                rarely use the same club twice in a row. </h3>
