            <p>The aim of rehabilitation is to maximise the potential to restore a person who has an impairment, or an
                incapacity for service or work, as a result of a service injury or disease to at least the same physical
                and
                psychological state, and at least the same social, vocational and educational status, as he or she had
                before
                the injury or disease.</p>

            <h3>What they were doing might be a good way to practice if the goal is to use one club to hit the same
                distance
                at the same target several times in a row. But it's a terrible way if you want to play well on a real
                course, where the lie is almost never perfectly level, there are delays between successive shots, and
                you
                rarely use the same club twice in a row. </h3>
